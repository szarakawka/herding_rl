- play herding with dog_count = 1   ... ok
- play herding with dog_count > 1   ... ok

- fix too many actions in manual steering

- sanity checks: predefined net with custom strategy hardcoded (for dog_count = 1  and > 1)
- fix errors for dog_count > 1
- run trpo learning with visualization
    - fix monitor and env usage
- enable tensorboard summaries


- experiment: dense net vs convolutional net
- experiment: use_tan_to_center=True vs use_tan_to_center=False
        - fix: use_tan_to_center=False cause it is not working currently
- experiment: curriculum learning vs "flat" learning
- experiment: trpo vs other rl-algorithm
