Done:
- play herding with dog_count = 1   ... done
- play herding with dog_count > 1   ... done
- fix too many actions in manual steering ... done
- fix env usage ... done
- check observations ... use_tan_to_center works ok in Herding play     ... done
- add: AgentObservationCompression and AgentObservationAids options
    - AgentObservationCompression option requires the distinction between agent observation
    (required by api) and agent rays (used for visualization and for calculating observations)
    ... done
- feature_request: herding config loadable from json (which should be copied to experiments_logs directories
similarily to agent/net config)  ... done
- enable tensorboard summaries   ... done partially : only rewards are collected, other data summaries
causes problems
- run trpo learning with visualization    ... this works
- Experiments with dog_count=1 for now:
    - temporarily remove multiagent wrapper  ... ok
    - investivate current reward function -> seams legit, because it is possible to train simple 1 dog,
    3 sheep problem, but sometimes gets very high causing instant termination of training:
- refactor reward_counter, add other reward_counters ... done

- check the output of a neural net: descrete or continuous? etc..



To fix:
- fix errors for dog_count > 1
- fix/check monitor
- fix other tensorboard summaries




Experiments/ideas:
- dense net with two channels vs compressed representation in one channel
(two channels multiplied elementwise)
- investigate the influence of various aids: No, compass, location, tan_to_mass_centre
- dense net vs convolutional net
- historical info to agents:
    - one-shot observation (1d-compressed representation)
    vs stack_of_history_observations (this will form a 2d input to conv_net)
- curriculum learning vs "flat" learning
- trpo vs other rl-algorithm
- agents of different sizes and different "weight"/"fear level"
- additional inputs that encode agent number (or role) in the team
        (one-hot encoding not possible, but maybe other)
- check reward calculator with exponential weight on sheep distances to herd_centre (so that
biblical 'good shepherd' can be trained)


Feature_requests:
- feature_request: variable number of dogs and sheep (within specified range) from episode to episode
- feature_req: refactor observation into two factors: rays + aids (of different shapes, types etc), because now
it is artificially concatenated together
